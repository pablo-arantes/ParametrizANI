# ParametrizANI
Dihedral Parametrization in the Cloud with TorchANI

## Hi there!

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook scripts to set up a protocol for parametrization of small molecules dihedrals for GAFF and OpenFF force fields using TorchANI, a PyTorch-based program for training/inference of ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models to obtain potential energy surfaces and other physical properties of molecular systems.  TorchANI is open-source and freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/aiqm/torchani.

The main goal of this work is to demonstrate how to harness the power of cloud-computing to parametrize compounds in a cheap and yet feasible fashion.
